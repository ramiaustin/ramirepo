# Overview

This document outlines a high-level architecture for the development of a Cloud Provisioning Hub designed to manage key functionalities, including a Consolidated Service Catalog, Order Processing, Order History, and Order Inventory. The solution leverages Backstage as the user interface, seamlessly integrated with Azure AD for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication. To support scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, the platform adopts a microservices-based architecture. Additionally, the design incorporates a robust database structure to efficiently handle and store transactional and configuration data. This architecture ensures that the platform can scale to meet future needs while providing a secure and user-friendly experience.
